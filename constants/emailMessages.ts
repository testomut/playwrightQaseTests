    Hi Qa,

    I really appreciate you joining us at Qatest and I know you'll love it when you see how easy it is to start having meaningful conversations with your leads and customers through simple little text messages.

    Before I had the idea for Qatest, I kept hearing the same problem from our customers at Call Loop...

    "We're calling people, but no one is returning our calls. We're sending emails, yet getting minimal replies. But like magic, when we send text messages, we get responses, setup appointments, qualify leads, and generate sales."

    And I'm excited to help you get amazing results too.

    If you wouldn't mind, I'd love it if you answered one quick questionâ€¦

    Why did you sign up for Qatest?

    I'm asking because knowing what made you sign up is really helpful for us in making sure that we're delivering on what our users want. Just hit "reply" and let me know.
